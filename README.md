# Data-Structures-And-Useful-Classes

This repository contains data structures I have created/edited to tailor to my needs. Mainly used for class projects and research source code.

Edit 1: Added Tree.java and Node.java which allow the creation of trees with multiple children. The addition of each node to the tree requires a parent node so that the addition is not random. In addition to that, the tree needs a String aas an identifier while being constructed so it is easy to keep track of. The main purpose of this data structure was to re-create student conversations from a flattened MySQL database for research purposes. Feel free to edit it however you like and to your uses. 

Edit 2: Added TextProcessor.java. Contains 2 methods: reverseSentences and reverseWords to do exactly as you think-to reverse sentences or words of a block of text. It was initially used to compare permutations of text and its effect on IBM Watson's Personality Insights, as part of my research project.
